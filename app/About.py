    The **Peaceful Armies of Kings** puzzle explores a variation of the classic chessboard independence problem.
    The goal is to determine the maximum size of `k` equal-sized armies of kings that can be placed on
    an `n x n` board such that no king from one army can attack a king from a different army.

    Navigate to the page to see the optimal placements, adjust the board size, and change the number of armies.
